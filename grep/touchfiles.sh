Red and yellow, orange and brown
Whirling, twirling round and round
Falling softly to the ground.

Little leaves fall softly down
To make a carpet on the ground.
Then, swish, the wind comes whistling by
And sends them dancing to the sky."

content2="    LITTLE RED HOOD
And Little little LITTLE wolf
Eyes are red
Heart are little
Feet are delicious
Somebody check my mental health
Bim bam bom bzzzzzzzzzz brr bam bam bam
All day in my head brrrrr ba ba bab aba abbaba
And little red
Maybe once more Red
Maybe once more little
Maybe once more Red Little together"
